					'<p>I\'ve long been aware of this attitude to Ragwort, and other so called "weeds". It is irrational thinking of a similar nature to racism and all the other stupid irrational hatreds people have.</p><blockquote><p>Within hours of the post about the "vile weed", more than 30 people had complained that he was <b>ecologically illiterate</b>, plain wrong or perpetuating myths put out about the plant by herbicide companies.</p></blockquote><p>This is precisely the problem, "ecological illiteracy". That it is the government\'s Minister for the Natural Environment and Fisheries, Richard Benyon expressing these views is nothing short of incredible. After all, presumably his department have enough advisers who could have quickly explained that he was a being a buffoon expressing his ignorance, before putting both feet in it - highlighting his ignorance and unsuitability for the position.</p><p>From what I understand the main problem with Ragwort poisoning in horses is being fed hay with dried Ragwort in it. They normally avoid eating live Ragwort in pastures.<br></p><blockquote><p>Benyon struck back, saying his critics were being "unnecessarily aggressive", and that he wasn\'t advocating ethnic cleansing of ragwort but that he wanted to deal with "a severe infestation of a poisonous plant".</p></blockquote><p><br>This is laughable, and clearly Richard Benyon has a problem with joined up thinking. He uses aggressive phrases like "vile weed" and "a severe infestation of a poisonous plant", whilst risibly accusing other of being "unnecessarily aggressive".</p><p>Matt Shardlow, the director of Buglife is very right when he says "a critically important nectar source for hundreds of species of butterflies, bees, moths, flies and other invertebrates". I tend to specialise in photographing feeding insects feeding in flowers, and I can confirm that Ragwort is an extremely important plant in sustaining pollinators. It is important not only because it is an attractive plant to pollinators, but because of the volume of it. I would describe it as one of our most important native plants for sustaining pollinator populations.</p><p>It is bizarre in the extreme, that there is a well recognised problem with the decline of pollinators, not just in the UK, but internationally. And here we have an uneducated buffoon, who has somehow found himself Minister for the Natural Environment and Fisheries, declaring war on an important native wildflower, which is of major importance in sustaining these species in serious decline. Species which are actually very important to farmers. This is why Richard Benyon is clearly "ecological illiteracy". I suggest that if Richard Benyon wants to do this job, then he urgently needs to educate himself about the subject.</p>',

					'<p>@ bordighera:<br></p><blockquote><p>Ragwort cannot be killled by any known selective weed-killer, It has to be pulled up by the roots.</p></blockquote><p>Not necessarily true. Pulling up by the roots can be one of the worst things you can do - remember this is a plant that loves to colonise bare ground, which is what you create when pulling existing plants up. This creates perfect oportunities for seed in the soil, or new seed rain to colonise those areas making it seem like the ragwort never went away. I have seen this happen many times.</p><p>As for other control methods, I am not an expert on herbicides, but it would appear there are numerous to choose from that will do the job - see the Defra code of practice, or for example the Centre for ecology and Hydrology information sheet on ragwort <a href="http://www.ceh.ac.uk/sci_programmes/documents/Ragwort.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ceh.ac.uk/sci_programmes/documents/Ragwort.pdf</a> (to name but two sources) for more info.</p>',

					'<p>@kvms ragwort is *not* "controlled" by pulling. First, you can\'t pull the rosette stage. Second, pulling the plant simply means that next year you\'ll have loads more plants to pull. The root system is quite complex even above ground. If you like pulling up ragwort, congratulations - you\'ve kept yourself in a job.</p><p>I wouldn\'t trust that "ragwort facts" site as it doesn\'t link out. Instead use PubMed where you can find some raw data, such as from <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=ragwort%20poison%20equine" rel="nofollow">this search</a>. </p><p>@SteB1 "From what I understand the main problem with Ragwort poisoning in horses is being fed hay with dried Ragwort in it. They normally avoid eating live Ragwort in pastures."</p><p>That\'s because the ragwort has a bitter taste (because of the alkalinoids). Once dried, the taste is lost. So the argument really is about controlling ragwort in fields that will be used for hay, and perhaps also for human food (I don\'t think you really want phlebotoxic contaminants in your basic food supply).</p><p>Ragwort quickly colonises bare ground (another reason why pulling, which leaves bare patches, isn\'t so clever); I think that\'s why Benyon is so frustrated with the Highways Agency, which is great at digging up roads but no so good at chucking grass seed over the bits once repaired.</p>',

					"<p>@CharlesArthur<br></p><blockquote><p><i>\"From what I understand the main problem with Ragwort poisoning in horses is being fed hay with dried Ragwort in it. They normally avoid eating live Ragwort in pastures.\"\n</i><br>That's because the ragwort has a bitter taste (because of the alkalinoids). Once dried, the taste is lost. So the argument really is about controlling ragwort in fields that will be used for hay, and perhaps also for human food (I don't think you really want phlebotoxic contaminants in your basic food supply).</p><p>Ragwort quickly colonises bare ground (another reason why pulling, which leaves bare patches, isn't so clever); I think that's why Benyon is so frustrated with the Highways Agency, which is great at digging up roads but no so good at chucking grass seed over the bits once repaired.</p></blockquote><p>Yes I'm well aware of some of the compounds in Ragwort and why horses supposedly avoid Ragwort in fields, but may eat it in hay. Although I think much of it is to do with the difference between the way horses selectively browse in fields, and the way they eat hay. Horses simply do not have the equipment to disentangle different plants from hay they are fed, so they are forced to eat whole, and not selectively as when thy browse. I should also add that I have formally studied herbivory, how some toxins operate biologically, and the secondary metabolites which inhibit herbivory. I was bought up in a rural area and I have known horsey people for most of my life. So I appreciate these aspects and have a good grasp of the rural attitude to Ragwort. I also understand the ecological prefererences of Ragwort, which is also important in understanding it's ecological importance in the modern era.</p><p>The main bit you miss out is that the wish to control Ragwort everywhere is because it has wind blown seed. In the countryside there is a traditional annoyance with landowners who don't control Ragwort as it is perceived that the seed from the Ragwort in their fields spreads elsewhere.</p><p>I admit it's quite some time since I have done specific reading on the toxicity of Ragwort. However, from what I can remember most of the literature appeared to imply that the dangers of Ragwort toxicity were somewhat exaggerated. This backs up my own experience. where I can't even think of an example of Ragwort toxicity in a horse. Although I have been personally aware of quite a few examples where people's horses have died or become ill with acorn poisoning. This has always what has struck me, horse owners are a bit obsessed with Ragwort, even though most of the things that effect horses aren't Ragwort poisoning.</p><p>I find that there is a very distorted view about \"poisonous plants\". Those that have these concerns often do not realise what a huge variety of our native plants species have pretty potent toxins in them. This tends to result in hysteria about some plants, where most people are not even aware that other plants they consider safe, are even more toxic.</p><p>Without doing a fair bit of reading to get up to date, my impression is that the toxicity of Ragwort is an overblown concern. The pre-occupation with Ragwort appears to be because it is a named plant in the 1959 Weeds Act. But the other named weeds are 2 Dock species and 2 Thistle species. This was a time of the green revolution and where our pasture was being turned into \"improved grassland\". In such grassland normally only one species of  grass (usually a Ryegrass sp.) is welcome, and 2 Clover species. Typically such grassland only contains about 5 species. The other species being those named in the Weeds Act, which farmers want to eliminate to increase yield. Species rich grassland can contain 80 species. We have lost over 90% of our species rich grassland. In other words, I personally think it's far more about Ragwort being one of the few species to invade \"improved grassland\", than it is about toxicity or danger.</p><p>The notion that there are good species, and bad species which need to be demomized, and war waged on them has done massive damage to the biodiversity our countryside. To see our countryside as containing bad, or enemy species, which have to be controlled at all costs is really a bit of an uninformed Victorian attitude. As I explained before, Ragwort is an important native plant for sustaining pollinator populations, which have been in serious decline. This is what makes these simplistic views about good and bad species problematic. Often the species seen as bad, had an unacknowledged positive role to play in the ecology of our countryside.</p><p>I have also seen little evidence to suggest Ragwort is any sort of real threat to human health.</p>",

It confirms many of my impressions. I\'ve have been baffled by Ragwort hysteria for a long time. Whilst it is a bit of a pre-occupation in equine circles, I was always a bit baffled because I wasn\'t aware of any specific cases where horses had definitely become ill due to Ragwort poisoning. Whereas I was aware of many examples of other types of poisoning such as horses eating large amounts of acorns. Although I am wary of these diagnoses, because often it appears to be more of a guess, and is often not confirmed by a post-morten.</p><p>A particular problem with concerns about plant toxicity, is that just because compounds are in plants, does not necessarily mean that they will be ingested in high enough levels to cause illness.</p>',

We can't cross check this because he removed the thread, presumably to hide his embarrassment. Do you just mean people pointed out that Richard Benyon doesn't appear to have any understanding of the ecological role Ragwort plays in supporting biodiversity? As he is the Minister responsible for biodiversity it was incumbent on those who understand the subject to point out that the Minister's comments were ill-informed, and showed an incredible degree ecological illiteracy for someone in such a role - a clear matter of public concern. Your comment is more like spin for the Minister than anything else. After all you've not said anything to support the validity of the Minister's ill-informed rant.</p>",

The reference you gave just gives a series of assertions and doesn\'t support or reference them.</p><p>I\'ve known about the supposed toxicity of Ragwort throughout most of my life. Several people in my family have been horse owners, and it is a big pre-occupation in the equine world. Also I knew about it because the caterpillars of Cinnabar moths supposedly were unpalatable because of a concentration of the Ragworts toxins. Initially I just accepted this as fact because it was repeated so much. However I started become sceptical because despite the equine world\'s pre-occupation with Ragwort I never knew of a definite Ragwort poisoning case. Yet I knew of other cases of horses being poisoned by eating other things, but not Ragwort. This was baffling given the prevalence of Ragwort in fields grazed by horses and in pasture cut for hay. I started to become suspicious that this was a "factoid" - an inaccurate assertion that gains credence over time by its repetition.</p><p>When I tried reading up on it some while back when I had access to an academic library I could find very little direct information about the supposed problem of Ragwort toxicity. Most of it just appeared to be unsupported assertions, and the anecdotal accounts weren\'t backed up by post-morten results. However, it was not enough of an issue for me to pursue it any further.</p><p>This is why I find @EstherHegt\'s comments and website so interesting, because it confirms my suspicions. At the very least the problem appears to be somewhat overstated.<br><a href="http://www.ragwort.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ragwort.org.uk/</a></p><p>On the subject of Ragwort\'s importance for supporting biodiversity. Yes you are right that it is not a rare plant. However, the groups of pollinating insects, to which Ragwort is important, are in serious decline. So it is the volume of food sources (flowers) important to this biodiversity component, and not just whether it is there or not. Photographing flower feeding insects has given me a lot of insight into which flower food sources are the most popular with feeding insects, and which are the most widespread and used. In my experience Ragwort is one of the most important single plants. In my experience perhaps only Hogweed supports more feeding insects, and is more widespread. I think the shot below is of a hoverfly on Ragwort. Although I don\'t use Ragwort too much for my photography as I use flash, and the smaller flowers mean you tend to get a black background. Here I managed to get a few flowers behind to prevent this.<br><a href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4018/4396328430_78f4045739_o.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4018/4396328430_78f4045739_o.jpg</a></p>',

					"<p>Just to clarify the point I am making. I'm not suggesting that those with livestock and who want to take precautions shouldn't control Ragwort in their pastures. What I am concerned about is the demonization of plants like Ragwort. This can lead to pointless wars waged against certain plants everywhere, with little thought about what this is meant to achieve, or the effect it has on other biodiversity. I often find interesting places to photograph insects. I return and everything has been cut down or sprayed (not particularly Ragwort). There doesn't appear to be any clear rationale for this, as often these places have no other purpose to serve, that the vegetation cut down or sprayed prevents. When I have asked about this, I often get puzzled looks, and told they are weeds, or need to be tidied up. A weed is only a plant growing where someone doesn't want it to grow. Unfortunately, many people who don't understand this concept appear to believe that being a weed, makes a plant inherently bad wherever it is, and it is necessary to wage constant war on weeds, regardless of where they are growing.</p>",
