'@guardian/discussion-rendering': major
---

Bring in the latest Source packages, which bring major visual changes to:
- Line height, which is now a little bit tighter
- `Link` & `LinkButton`, which no longer have a subdued setting and come with
  an underline for accessibility
- Pillar colours, which have been tweaked to provide higher contrast
