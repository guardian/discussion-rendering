This release introduces a change in its peer dependencies, which is a always a
breaking change.

- @guardian/libs@^12.0.0 (from ^10.0.0)

Consumers should consider upgrading their local versions of libs, which only
brings two major changes:

- [Formats update in v12](https://github.com/guardian/csnx/blob/main/libs/%40guardian/libs/CHANGELOG.md#1200)
- [Specified typescript version in v11](https://github.com/guardian/csnx/blob/main/libs/%40guardian/libs/CHANGELOG.md#1100)
