I also came across to following Twitter feed today which was posted by a doctor in Italy.</p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/silviast9/status/1236933818654896129" rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/silviast9/status/1236933818654896129</a></p> <p>It paints a rather start picture of what is happening in Italy and the health service in Italy is better resourced than ours.</p> <p>Then there is obviously the fact that the health service staff in Italy do the best that they can just like our own health professionals do so that alone will not carry us in the event of a large scale situation with this virus.</p> <p>I honestly hope my skepticism is unfounded but I am struggling to see that it is.</p>',
