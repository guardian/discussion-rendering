# @guardian/discussion-rendering

## 13.0.0

### Major Changes

- bcd2a21: This release introduces a change in its peer dependencies, which is a always a
  breaking change.

  - @guardian/libs@^12.0.0 (from ^10.0.0)

  Consumers should consider upgrading their local versions of libs, which only
  brings two major changes:

  - [Formats update in v12](https://github.com/guardian/csnx/blob/main/libs/%40guardian/libs/CHANGELOG.md#1200)
  - [Specified typescript version in v11](https://github.com/guardian/csnx/blob/main/libs/%40guardian/libs/CHANGELOG.md#1100)

## 12.0.0

### Major Changes

- 22c1d98: ### What
  Add required prop `idApiUrl` to the discussion App. The url is coming from CAPI and passed via DCR.

  ### Why

  The previous version of discussion-rendering had the prod identity url hardcoded and was hitting this regardless of environment. This was causing CORS errors when trying to post a comment as `https://m.code.dev-theguardian.com/` is not one of the allowed domains to hit the prod api.

  ### How to consume

  This change handles the consumption of `idApiUrl` by the application.
